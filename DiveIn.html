                    <br> This graphs is reporting the source of each reported attack. What we see, and I believe to be quite interesting, is the fact that the main origin of these attacks is, at 
                    least in this dataset, national. Nation-states are mandating silent and stealthy cyberattacks in order to reinforce their own national interests, something that might resemble the operational 
                    tactics of Cold War.

                    are set up and used at the same time, creating a multi-layered defense system.

    <h3>IT</h3>
</div>

<div class="top">
    <p class="typewriter"> IT mostly received its attacks from unknown sources, why is that? We need to consider the <span id="evidenzia"> nature of the industry</span>. <br>
        Being it highly technological and, at the same time, highly remunerative, it is the ideal target for cyberattacks. <br>
        With this said, it is reasonable to think that the higher degree of technology quality used and developed by these companies also applies to their security levels. <br> 
        Higher security levels might require better skilled cyber attackers, that are more capable of hiding themselves and not being caught. <br>
        At the same time, we might also try to explain the higher amount of "unknowns" taking into account the chance of companies sabotaging each others. <br>
        If what we have just said is true, it is not impossible for these same companies to mandate organized attacks against their own rivals. <br>
        They have the tools, they might also have the will to act. <br><br>
        Healthcare follows the same statistical trend.
</div>

<div class="minititle">
    <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
</div>

<div class="top"> 
    <p class="typewriter"> What happens in the field of Education is different. <br>
        Nation-states and insiders are the main sources of attack by far. Unknowns and hacker-groups are clearly behind. <br>
        If we apply the same logic used before, we need to explore the nature of the industry. Education is, in fact, substantially different. It is, mainly, a <span id="evidenzia"> public field</span>.<br>
        Therefore it does not carry extra-national interests but, because of its nature, it accounts for a vital part of a Nation. <br>
        Attacking these kind of fields can have tragic impacts on citizens, governments and a Nation as a whole. Hence, it is clear why Nation-states attacks are so high. <br>
        In a world where competition between States never ceased, new forms of war are emerging and cyberattacks are one of them. <br>
        The higher amount of insider attacks might be explainable by the fact that, usually, workers in this field are underpaid. If we add on top of this the general access to <br>
        digital structures that is usually given to these workers we have a easily corruptible operative insider. <br><br>
        Banking and Retail follow the same statistical trend.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="minititle">
    <h3>GOVERNMENT</h3>
</div>

<div class="top"> 
    <p class="typewriter"> Government is the most balanced of the fields. <br>
        It received attacks from everywhere, nothing specific. It is interesting to note that even the Nation-states attacks are not extremely high. <br>
        This might probably be due to the fact that is clearly harder, and way more dangerous, attacking a government backed digital structure. <br>
        An attack against, let's say, the website of a university does not constitute an act of war (as for now). Can we say the same for an attack led directly agaisnt government institutions? <br>
        It is way better for rival Nations to organize swarms of attacks against everything that surrounds governments, but not institutions themselves. <br>
        Cyberattacks are used exactly to avoid setting off a war while, at the same time, aiming at generating the same disruptive effects. <br><br>
        Telecommunication follows the same statistical trend.

    <h4>--- CONCLUSIONS ---</h4>
</div>

<div class="top"> 
    <p class="typewriter"> We have explored how these different industries have been attacked. <br>
        What is crucial is to consider the fact that, nowdays, everyone can and probably will be attacked. <br>
        This underlines the importance of knowing what are the ways of defending oneself. <br>
        Because it is not a matter of if, but when. <br><br>

        The only exception is the attack count that, by nature, has to be calculted using absolute values. <br><br>
        The section will end with a brief discussion on the results given by the graphs and a leaderboard. <br>
        The leaderboard results are calculted in this way: 3 points for each first place, 2 points for each second place and 1 point for each third place. <br>

            <p> DDoS wins the "Stealer" award. Being an attack able to completely shut down entire systems it is no surprise to see it dominate this category. Man-in-the-middle reconfirms its danger getting second place, Phishing follows.</p>

            <p> It is now Malware's turn to lead a category. Probably due to its ever-changing nature and multiple forms, the time required to fix a Malware induced attack is relatively higher. SQL Injection follows second, while Man-in-the-Midle makes another appearance.</p>

            <p> Phishing wins this last category winning the "Rookie" award. Its growth may probably be due to the emergence of AI tools able to imitate almost perfectly human interactions, that is what Phishing is based on. Man-in-the-Middle and Ransomware are largely left behind.</p>
